/**
 * @file
 *
 * Exports an interface to the irpmondll.dll library. The library forms an user
 * mode part of the system for monitoring various driver and device-related events.
 *
 *  HOW TO USE
 *
 *  *  Initialize the library by a call to the @link(IRPMonDllInitialize) routine.
 *     The current process is connected to the IRPMon driver and the library is now 
 *     ready to work.
 *  *  Retrieve information about drivers and devices currently present in the system
 *     (@link(IRPMonDllSnapshotRetrieve)). The retrieved data must be released by the
 *     @link(IRPMonDllSnapshotFree) procedure when no longer needed.
 *  *  Retrieve the list of drivers and devices currently monitored (and hooked) by the
 *     IRPMon driver. The @link(IRPMonDllDriverHooksEnumerate) does this. Free the returned
 *     information by using the @link(IRPMonDllDriverHooksFree) procedure. The "HookHandle"
 *     member of the structures describing the hooked objects can be used in library functions
 *     described below.
 *  *  Hook a new driver by specifying its name to the @link(IRPMonDllHookDriver) function. This
 *     call instructs the IRPMon driver to store information about the target driver within its
 *     data structures. The actual monitoring must be started by the @link(IRPMonDllDriverStartMonitoring) 
 *     function. @link(IRPMonDllDriverStopMonitoring) stops the monitoring. 
 *  *  Unhook a given driver by passing its hook handle to the @link(IRPMonDllUnhookDriver) function.
 *     The monitoring must not be active. Otherwise, the function fails. 
 *  *  Use the @link(IRPMonDllDriverSetInfo) to change monitoring settings of a hooked driver. If the monitoring
 *     is active, only the value of the MonitorNewDevices setting is propagated to the IRPMon driver.
 *  *  Determine which device objects of a driver should be monitored. Use @link(IRPMonDllHookDeviceByName),
 *     @link(IRPMonDllHookDeviceByAddress) and @link(IRPMonDllUnhookDevice) to tell this to the IRPMon driver.
 * 
 *   COLLECTIONG EVENTS
 *
 *   * Use the @link(IRPMonDllConnect) to connect the current process to the IRPMon Event Queue. You can supply
 *     a semaphore object the counter of which is increased by the IRPMon driver every time an event is added to
 *     the queue. During initialization of the connection, the driver increments the counter by a number of events
 *     currently stored in the queue. 
 *     At most one process can be connected to the queue at any moment of time.
 *   * Disconnect the process by calling the @link(IRPMonDllDisconnect) function.
 *   * Retrieve individual events from the queue via the @link(IRPMonDllGetRequest)
 *     function.
