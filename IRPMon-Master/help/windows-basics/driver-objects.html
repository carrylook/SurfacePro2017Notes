<h1>Driver Objects</h1>
<p>
Each loaded driver is represented by a kernel object of Driver type. The structure of the object body is defined as <code>DRIVER_OBJECT</code> and you can see it below. This chapter describes its members that are interesting in the IRPMon context. The most interesting structure fields in that aspect are printed in bold.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 1:</b> The <code>DRIVER_OBJECT</code> structure<br/>
<code><pre>
typedef struct _DRIVER_OBJECT {
    CSHORT Type;
    CSHORT Size;
    PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject;
    ULONG Flags;
    PVOID DriverStart;
    ULONG DriverSize;
    PVOID DriverSection;
    <b>PDRIVER_EXTENSION DriverExtension;</b>
    UNICODE_STRING DriverName;
    PUNICODE_STRING HardwareDatabase;
    <b>PFAST_IO_DISPATCH FastIoDispatch</b>;
    <b>PDRIVER_INITIALIZE DriverInit;</b>
    <b>PDRIVER_STARTIO DriverStartIo;</b>
    <b>PDRIVER_UNLOAD DriverUnload;</b>
    <b>PDRIVER_DISPATCH MajorFunction[0x1C];</b>
} DRIVER_OBJECT;
</pre></code>
</p>
<p>
As said in <a href='drivers-and-devices.html'>Drivers and Devices</a> chapter, each device is associated with one driver. This fact can also be viewed from the driver perspective: each driver own none, one or multiple devices. The devices owned by one driver are stored in a singly linked list and address of its first item (first device) is stored inside the <code>DeviceObject</code> member of the driver object body. Each device, described by the <code>DEVICE_OBJECT</code>, contains a pointer to the next device in the list (the <code>NextDevice</code> filed of the device object body).
</p>
<p>
<code>DriverStart</code> and <code>DriverSize</code> members describe position of the driver image in memory: its base address and size in bytes.
</p>
<h2><i>DriverEntry</i> and IRP handling</h2>
<p>
Address of the <i>DriverEntry</i> routine is stored within the <code>DriverInit</code> field. The routine is invoked just after the driver image is mapped to kernel memory and it is responsible for the whole driver initialization. If a driver can be dynamically unloaded, it sets the <code>DriverUnload</code> field to point to its unload routine, which is invoked just before unmapping the driver image from memory. If the driver does not set its unload routine (<code>DriverUnload</code> is <b><code>NULL</code></b>) the driver cannot be unloaded from the system without a reboot.
</p>
<p>
The <code>MajorFunction</code> array defines all callback routines responsible for handling IRPs. When sending a request to driver's device, the kernel selects appropriate callback routine from the array by using the major type of the request as an index. All the callbacks stored in the <code>MajorFunction</code> array has the same signature named <code>DRIVER_DISPATCH</code> showed in Listing 2. The callbacks accept two arguments, the device object to which the request just arrived, and the request itself. They return a NTSTATUS value indicating whether the request was completed and how successfully the driver handled it.
</p>
<p>
<b>Listing 2:</b> Signature of the callback routines responsible for handling IRPs<br/>
<code>typedef NTSTATUS (NTAPI DRIVER_DISPATCH)(PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject, PIRP Irp);
</code>
</p>
<h2><i>StartIo</i> and fast I/O</h2>
<p>
Driver's <i>StartIo</i> can be used to serialize request targeted at certain device or driver. Its signature reflects the <code>DRIVER_DISPATCH</code> type, however, there are some differences from callbacks stored inside the <code>MajorFunction</code> array:
</p>
<ul>
<li>there may be at most one StartIo routine defined per driver, thus serving all types of requests,</li>
<li>the routine handles only requests passed to it by the owning driver,</li>
<li>the routine does not support device stacks or any other type of layering</li>
<li>the routine is optional, the driver can decide not to define any. When a driver decides not to define one of its IRP callbacks, the callback points to a default handler inside the kernel, called <b>IopInvalidDeviceRequest</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If a driver decides to support also fast I/O method of communication (which is completely optional unless the driver is a file system or file system filter), the <i>DriverEntry</i> routine allocates a <code>FAST_IO_DISPATCH</code> structure and stores its address in the <code>FastIoDispatch</code> field of its driver object structure. The <code>FAST_IO_DISPATCH</code> structure consists of various callbacks with various signatures. The callbacks are invoked at various times and places. If the driver does not support fast I/O, it just leaves the <code>FastIoDispatch</code> field as is.
</p>
<h2>AddDevice</h2>
<p>
When a driver supports Plug&Play (PnP), it needs to be informed when a device of interesting type is connected to the computer (either physically or virtually). This purpose is served by the <i>AddDevice</i> routine which is stored in an extension of the driver object (address of the extension is stored in the <code>DriverExtension</code> field). Definition of the driver extension structure and signature of the <i>AddDevice</i> routine are described in Listing 3.
</p>
<p><b>Listing 3:</b> Structure of the driver extension and signature of the <i>AddDevice</i> routine<br/>
<code><pre>
typedef NTSTATUS (DRIVER_ADD_DEVICE) (
  struct _DRIVER_OBJECT *DriverObject,
  struct _DEVICE_OBJECT *PhysicalDeviceObject);

typedef struct _DRIVER_EXTENSION {
    struct _DRIVER_OBJECT *DriverObject;
    <b>PDRIVER_ADD_DEVICE AddDevice;</b>
    ULONG Count;
    UNICODE_STRING ServiceKeyName;
} DRIVER_EXTENSION, *PDRIVER_EXTENSION;
</pre></code>
</p>
<p>
When the kernel considers a driver is worth of being informed about arrival of a new device, it invokes its <i>AddDevice</i> routine. If the driver is not loaded in memory, the kernel does so and does not forget to initialize the driver via its <i>DriverEntry</i>. The kernel passes the following parameters to the <i>AddDevice</i> routine:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>DriverObject</code>. Address of the driver object representing the driver.</li>
<li><code>PhysicalDeviceObject</code>. Address of the bottom device object in the device stack representing the newly arrived device.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If driver's <i>AddDevice</i> routine considers the newly arrived device interesting enough, it usually creates a new device object and attaches it to the top of the stack, making the driver able of monitoring and filtering all IRPs going to the new device.
</p>
<p>
A driver may define its <i>AddDevice</i> routine during its <i>DriverEntry</i> by setting the <code>AddDevice</code> member of its driver extension structure. Drivers that have <i>AddDevice</i> routine are sometimes called <i>Plug&Play drivers</i> (<i>PnP drivers</i>).
